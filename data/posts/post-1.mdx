## Introduction
Kotlin Extensions are a powerful feature in Kotlin that allows you to add new functions to existing classes without modifying their source code. These functions are called extension functions.

```kotlin
fun String.hasSpaces(): Boolean {
    return this.contains(" ")
}
```

In this example, we’ve added a new function hasSpaces() to the String class. This function checks if the string contains any spaces.

## Using Extension Functions
You can use extension functions just like any other function in the class. Here’s how you can use the hasSpaces() function:

```kotlin
val myString = "Hello, World!"
println(myString.hasSpaces()) // prints: true
```

## Conclusion
Kotlin Extensions provide a clean and concise way to add functionality to existing classes. They’re a great tool to have in your Kotlin toolbox!
